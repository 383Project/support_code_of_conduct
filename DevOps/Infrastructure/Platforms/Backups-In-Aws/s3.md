## S3 Backups - Bucket Versioning

In S3 we can use version history to backup files.

Buckets can be in one of three states;
 - Unversioned (the default)
 - Versioning-enabled
 - Versioning-suspended

After you version-enable a bucket, it can never return to an unversioned state. But you can suspend versioning on that bucket.

The versioning state applies to all (never some) of the objects in that bucket. When you enable versioning in a bucket, all existing and new objects are versioned and given a unique version ID. 

The bucket owner (or any user with appropriate permissions) can suspend versioning to stop accruing object versions. When you suspend versioning, existing objects in your bucket do not change.

## Enable S3 Versioning

To enable versioning on an S3 bucket navigate to `S3` in AWS and select the bucket you wish to enable versioning on and click on the `Properties` tab. Here you'll be able to see if the bucket has versioning enabled or not.
